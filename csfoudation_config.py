"""csorchestrator configuration for csfoundation.

This module defines the authoritative project name and version as single
sources of truth, the first-party libraries of the project together with
their (cross-repo) managed dependencies, the Linux system requirements
installer, and two installation helpers:

* ``install_csfoundation_build_dependencies`` — internal use (the CI recipe in
  ``csfoundation_project.py``): installs the system requirements and downloads
  the manifest, the bundles, and only the required (pre-)compiled libraries
  from the ``third_party_base_libs`` and ``csqt6`` GitHub releases that are
  needed to *build* csfoundation from source.
* ``auto_install_csorchestrator_managed_libraries`` — customer-facing helper,
  deployed to the release via ``additional_files_list``: does everything the
  internal helper does and additionally downloads the requested prebuilt
  first-party libraries (``csCore``, ``csLie``, ...) from the ``csfoundation``
  GitHub release itself.

Both helpers delegate to the installers of the consumed releases, which are
downloaded into ``libs/`` and imported lazily (``_managed_library_config``):
deleting ``libs/`` — or a part of it — is safe, it is re-downloaded on demand.

# managed dependencies, derived from the "Library Dependency Graph" section of
# README.md.
#
# Dependencies are kept in one map per providing release so that each
# installer talks to exactly one release without ``if lib == "qt6"`` style
# filtering:
# * ``FIRST_PARTY_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES`` — internal edges between first-party
#   libraries (e.g. ``csLie -> csCore``); used to expand a request to its
#   transitive closure before per-release resolution.
# * ``THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES`` — managed libraries provided by the
#   ``third_party_base_libs`` release, as needed by downstream customers
#   (test-only dependencies excluded).
# * ``THIRD_PARTY_TEST_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES`` — extra ``third_party_base_libs``
#   entries needed only to build & run this repo's own tests (the CI phase
#   runs Configure-Build-Test-Install). Merged in only when
#   ``include_test_dependencies=True``.
# * ``QT6_LIBRARY_DEPENDENCIES`` — managed libraries provided by the ``csqt6``
#   release (only ``csVisOpenGL`` needs ``qt6``).
#
# Transitive dependencies *internal* to a dependency release (e.g. cpptrace
# pulled in by libassert) are not repeated: they are auto-filled by the
# dependency project's own helper.
